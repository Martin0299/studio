# **App Name**: LunaBloom

## Core Features:

- Top Tab Bar Navigation: Implement a top tab bar navigation for easy access to the Calendar, Log, Insights, and Settings screens. The active tab should be clearly indicated with a highlighted icon/label and a subtle transition animation.
- Customizable Calendar View: Design a customizable calendar view with clear visual cues for period days, predicted period days, fertile window, predicted ovulation day and logged data. Tapping a day should open a popup with a summary of the logged data.
- Intuitive Log Entry Screen: Create a log entry screen for tracking menstruation, symptoms, mood, vaginal discharge, and sexual activity. The design should provide clear visual feedback on selection and allow for quick and effortless input.

## Style Guidelines:

- Muted pastels (dusty rose, soft teal, lavender) with clean white/off-white backgrounds (light mode) and deep charcoal/navy backgrounds (dark mode).
- Accent color: Warm coral (#FF7F50) or soft gold (#FFD700) to highlight key elements and actions.
- Consistent icon style (clean line icons or soft filled icons). Icons should be intuitive and aesthetically pleasing.
- Clean, organized layouts with distinct sections/cards for different input sections. Use of white space to avoid clutter.
- Subtle tap animations on buttons and smooth transitions between screens to enhance the user experience.
